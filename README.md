# Tweet Harvest (Twitter Crawler)

Tweet Harvest is a command-line tool that uses Playwright to scrape tweets from Twitter search results based on specified keywords and date range. The scraped tweets are saved in a CSV file.

**Note: This script is for educational purposes only. Twitter prohibits unauthenticated users from performing search or advanced search. To use this script, you need to have a valid Twitter account and obtain an Access Token, which can be obtained by logging into Twitter in your browser and extracting the `auth_token` cookie.**

## How to Use

To use Tweet Harvest, follow these simple steps:
1. Install Node.js (LTS) on your computer.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Type `npx tweet-harvest@latest` and press Enter.
4. Follow the prompts to provide the data you want to search for on Twitter, such as keywords, dates, and other parameters.

Thatâ€™s it! Tweet Harvest will open a Chromium browser instance and navigate to Twitter's search page. It will then enter your search parameters and scrape the resulting tweets. The tweets will be saved in a CSV file in a directory named tweets-data in the current working directory.

Note: You will need a Twitter auth token to use this tool. When prompted, enter your Twitter auth token to authenticate your search.
